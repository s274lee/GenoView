Description: Superimposing input data over existing genomic references
        allows for fast, accurate visual comparisons. The GenoView
        package is a novel bioinformatics package which condenses
        genomic data tracks to offer a comprehensive view of genetic
        variants. Its main function is to display mutation data over
        exons and protein domains, which easily identifies potential
        genomic locations of interest.
